# Scheduling_System



ideas!
so i guess a weighted score determiens if its chosen. but this should not be deterministic.
this is simulating the human mind.
so its a chaotic mmess of: things like: individual words, memoryies, ideas, thoughts, tasks to do, etc.
the weighted score for each one. and they are chosen statistically. larger scores have a higher likelyhood of being chosen. and depending on the category of metadata like deadline, priority becomes ecponential

maybe category of items in queue can either be chosen to decay or not decay. tasks to do should have a weak or no absolute decay. but random memories nad vocab shoud

1. this system is purely logical. its a component in a larger system. its not observed by the user that uses but directs it. hence, it must be the most logical as possible. nuance and uniqueness is built on this.

subcategories such as tags are still a good idea, but again, these only exist hidden to the user.

2. forgotten entities will never appear on its own. forgetting is basically deletion or in transformer language, weights becomes negligible. existing but contribute almost nothing.

for something to have significance or reappear, then it must be added externally.


3. weight boosts are a natural part of the model but its execution is dependent on external factors. 

4. decay is automatic. after n cycles or some arbitrary rule, all items are decayed based on predefined logic

5. unrelated activation is just a phenomenon which occurs when an improabably item is chosen for processing. 

the way these items get added in the first place are agin, external. 

6. entities based on similarity can influence each other by boosting each otherr. however, this is a todo for now. a robust system for likeness identitfication is necessary first.

7. performance is to be decided.
